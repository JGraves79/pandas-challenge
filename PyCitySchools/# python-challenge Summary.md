## Overall Summary

The analyis combining the two sets of data schools_complete.csv and students_complete.csv show us the combined data of 15 schools within this school district of 
39,170 students. With this information we are able to determine the combined scoring averages for the schools as well as the breakdown between the type of school and school sizes and the performance between those different groups.

# Analysis

From the current reporting, we can conclude from the information a couple things.

#1  School size
    The smaller a school is in terms of total students, the better the overall performance is (reading and math averages). This is true for all schools up to 2000 total students. When schools start to get bigger than that, overall grades tend to go down significantly. Additionally, charter schools tend to do better than the district schools, but they also tend to be smaller. Only one charter school has over 2000 students, so again, it shows that smaller schools tend to do better.

#2  Per student spending
    Additionally, total spending and per student spending does not directly correlate to the best scores. This could be from a variety of factors and the data is incomplete in this area. It does not show the ratio of students to teachers or all faculty. It may be that some schools have lower student-teacher ratios giving the spending a higher value per student, or there is more spending in other areas that are not defined, so it cannot be determined how the cost per student is related. It does show that the lowest spending quartile, those spending <$585 per student, indicates the highest overall passing % as well as higher averages in all categories.
