# PyCity Schools Analysis

Python Assignment 4 for Bootcamp

## Overview

This project involves analyzing school district data to understand various metrics related to student performance and school spending. The analysis is performed using Python and pandas, and the results are presented in a Jupyter Notebook.

## Data

The data used in this analysis includes information about schools and students, such as:
- School names and types (Charter or District)
- Student names, IDs, and grades
- Scores in reading and math
- School budgets and sizes

## Analysis

Assignment summary analysis is available on the python-challenge Summary file
The analysis is divided into several sections:

### District Summary
- **Total Schools**: The number of unique schools in the district.
- **Total Students**: The total number of students.
- **Total Budget**: The total budget for all schools.
- **Average Math Score**: The average math score across all students.
- **Average Reading Score**: The average reading score across all students.
- **% Passing Math**: The percentage of students with math scores of 70 or higher.
- **% Passing Reading**: The percentage of students with reading scores of 70 or higher.
- **% Overall Passing**: The percentage of students passing both math and reading.

### School Summary
- **School Type**: The type of each school (Charter or District).
- **Total Students**: The total number of students per school.
- **Total School Budget**: The total budget per school.
- **Per Student Budget**: The budget per student for each school.
- **Average Math Score**: The average math score per school.
- **Average Reading Score**: The average reading score per school.
- **% Passing Math**: The percentage of students passing math per school.
- **% Passing Reading**: The percentage of students passing reading per school.
- **% Overall Passing**: The percentage of students passing both math and reading per school.

### Performance Analysis
- **Top Performing Schools**: Schools with the highest overall passing percentages.
- **Bottom Performing Schools**: Schools with the lowest overall passing percentages.
- **Math Scores by Grade**: Average math scores for each grade (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) per school.
- **Reading Scores by Grade**: Average reading scores for each grade (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) per school.

### Spending Analysis
- **Scores by School Spending**: Analysis of how spending per student affects average scores and passing percentages.
- **Scores by School Size**: Analysis of how school size affects average scores and passing percentages.
- **Scores by School Type**: Comparison of performance between Charter and District schools.

## Dependencies

To run this analysis, you will need the following Python packages:
- pandas
- pathlib

## Installation

git clone https://github.com/JGraves79/pandas-challenge.git  
cd pandas-challenge  
cd PyCitySchools  
Open the `PyCitySchools_assignment.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook.  
Run the cells to perform the analysis.

## Results

The results of the analysis provide insights into how different factors such as school type, size, and spending impact student performance. This information can be used to make data-driven decisions to improve educational outcomes.
